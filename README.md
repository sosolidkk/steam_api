# steam_api

A Ruby gem for interacting with the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API). This gem provides a structured and user-friendly way to fetch various types of data from Steam's API endpoints, such as game details, player information, and achievements.

## Features

- Fetch game details, news, and global achievements.
- Retrieve player summaries, friends, achievements, and game stats.
- Get owned games, recently played games, and Steam levels.
- Supports both authenticated and unauthenticated requests.
- Easy-to-use client configuration.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
$ bundle add steam_api
```

Or install it manually:

```bash
$ gem install steam_api
```

Then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

### Configuring the Client

```ruby
SteamApi::Client.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = "your-API-token-value"
end
```

Alternatively, you can initialize the client directly:

```ruby
client = SteamApi::Client.new("your-API-token-value")
```

### Example Requests

#### Get Player Summaries

```ruby
client = SteamApi::Client.new("your-API-token-value")
client.player_summaries.retrieve([76561198160009756])
```

#### Get App Details

```ruby
client = SteamApi::Client.new
client.app_details.retrieve(appid: 1091500, filters: ["basic"])
```

For more examples, see the [Usage](#usage) section above.
